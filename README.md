### **Project Title: Automated PDF Report Generation using Python**

As part of my internship at CodTech, I undertook the second task which involved developing an **automated report generation system** using Python. The primary objective of this project was to design a script that could read data from a structured file (such as a CSV), perform data analysis using Python libraries like **pandas**, and then generate a formatted and readable **PDF report** using a library like **FPDF**. This task allowed me to combine both data analysis and document automation, which are critical skills in real-world data-driven applications.

#### **Objective:**

The goal of this task was to eliminate manual reporting by creating a system that would automatically:

1. Ingest sales data from a CSV file.
2. Analyze the data to calculate meaningful metrics (like total revenue).
3. Generate a well-formatted PDF report summarizing the results.

#### **Tools and Technologies Used:**

* **Python**: The main programming language used to develop the solution.
* **Pandas**: For reading and processing data from the CSV file.
* **FPDF**: A lightweight Python library used to create and customize PDF reports.

#### **Implementation Process:**

1. **Reading the Data:**
   I started by collecting sample sales data in a CSV format. The dataset contained basic sales information including Date, Product, and Revenue. I used the pandas `read_csv()` method to read the data into a DataFrame for analysis.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   Using pandas, I performed basic analysis such as:

   * Summing up the total revenue.
   * Grouping sales by product to understand product-wise performance.
   * Converting revenue values to numerical format for further computations.

3. **Report Generation:**
   Once the data was analyzed, I proceeded to create the PDF report using the FPDF library. I structured the PDF to include:

   * A title for the report.
   * A tabular display of the sales data.
   * A section summarizing the total revenue earned during the recorded period.
   * Basic formatting like font size, alignment, and spacing to improve readability.

4. **Handling Issues:**
   During development, I encountered some common issues like:

   * Unicode errors due to special characters (like the Indian Rupee symbol ₹), which I resolved by removing non-Latin characters or switching to plain text representations.
   * File path errors and CSV formatting issues, which were fixed by correcting file locations and cleaning the headers of the CSV file.

5. **Final Output:**
   The final PDF report was successfully generated, containing all the necessary information in a clean and professional format. This file can be directly shared or printed, thus reducing the time and effort needed for manual reporting.

#### **Learning Outcomes:**

* I learned how to integrate **data analysis with document generation**, which is a valuable skill in business intelligence, finance, and administrative roles.
* I became proficient in using pandas for data manipulation and FPDF for dynamic report creation.
* I learned to troubleshoot and resolve encoding errors and data-related bugs effectively.

#### **Conclusion:**

This task not only tested my programming skills but also gave me practical exposure to real-world automation scenarios. The ability to convert raw data into meaningful reports without manual effort is a valuable asset in many industries. Through this project, I gained deeper insight into the **importance of automation in reporting**, and it further strengthened my confidence in working with Python-based data projects.
